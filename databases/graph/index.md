#### History 

The concept of property graphs, which are now the most common type of graph database, was first introduced in the early 2000s by the Neo4j team. They developed a graph database that could store data with properties on both nodes and edges, allowing for more complex modeling of relationships between entities.

#### Intro 

* Most **relational** databases stores data in the shape of tables and joins
* Graph databases stores data in the shape of a graph (like network) - having relations between them 

#### Graph databases 

- always finding the first index and then following memory pointers 
- query  langue   [Cypher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypher_(query_language))
* data stored in Nodes
* each Node has different properties 
	* name : Admin
	* weight : 30
	* height : 2.2
* each node has a **label** (for seperation)
* you can add **properties** to relationships
