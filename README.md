# cheat-cheet

* Complete cheat sheet made through out the 2nd semester of CS
* Includes all requirements and much more for personal use 
* This Cheat-sheet was made in my local enviroment with [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) since I love it and use it on daily basis for the development and my personal work
* Most of the styling and navigations with task I have made is not visible however if you have any questions or you want me to show you how I detaily planned it please get back to me !
* Some of the stuff has not been pushed since I has slight problem with version controll for this cheet sheet hopefully should cover everything .
* Mostly I have learned a lot from just making it !
