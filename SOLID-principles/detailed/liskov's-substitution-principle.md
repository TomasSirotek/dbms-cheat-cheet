#### Description 

* Principle states that objects of a **superclass** should be able **to be replaced** with objects of **any** of its subclasses **without** affecting the correctness of the program.
* In other words, if you have a **method** that takes an object of a **superclass** as a parameter, you should be able to pass in **any** object of **any** of its subclasses, and the method should behave **correctly**.
